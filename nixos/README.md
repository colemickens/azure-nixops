loosely organized stuff to help buidling and deploying a nixos vhd to azure

h/t: @phreedom did all of the heavy lifting

deploy-via-nixops.sh is unfinished/untested. I've barely started looking at nixops.

You'll need to build from `nixops-master` branch from @phreedom to get the Azure NixOps stuff as it's not merged yet.
